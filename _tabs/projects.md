# The Legend of the Crying Potato

I was bored and I decided to start on a Java game with no plan, goals, or reasoning behind it. I also wanted to not use a game engine <span style="font-style:italic">because I am an idiot<span>

## Features!
<ul>
    <li>Velocity-based movement</li>
    <li>Maybe-not-so-smart enemies</li>
    <li>Level-based progression</li>
    <li>Very sad story about a potato who loses everything</li>
</ul>
