# The Legend of the Crying Potato

I was bored and I decided to start on a Java game with no plan, goals, or reasoning behind it. I also wanted to not use a game engine <span style="font-style:italic">because I am an idiot</span>

## Features!
<ul>
    <li>Velocity-based movement</li>
    <li>Maybe-not-so-smart enemies</li>
    <li>Level-based progression</li>
    <li>Very sad story about a potato who loses everything</li>
</ul>

Once the first demo of the game is finished, I will release the source code and upload the completed game on 
<a href=https://www.itch.io>itch.io</a> and probably <a href="https://gamejolt.com">GameJolt</a>, but for now you can 
look at this picture of the main character. I will probably also release devlogs on my YouTube channel at some point, 
once I get that up and running
